# Yang Yongyi(杨永祎)

Yongyi is a senior student at Fudan University, under supervision of [Prof. Qiu Xipeng](https://xpqiu.github.io/). Currently he is having an internship at [Amazon Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/ailab/ "However, this website is too ugly I don't recommend you visiting it...") and has his fortune to be advised by [Dr. David Wipf](http://www.davidwipf.com/) and [Prof. Huang Zengfeng](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~huangzf/). 

His recent research interests include graph representation learning and optimization-induced models.

He is going to the University of Michigan to persue Ph.D. study, under supervision of Prof. [Wei Hu](http://weihu.me/).
